This Homework assignment answers three exercises that involve OpenCV.
Exercises 1, 2, and 3 are done in this repository.  
Answers to exercises 1 and 2's questions are in the docx file, while the rest of the work is done in python files.
Exercise 2 (colorimage.py) is done using the baboon image.
Exercise 3 (noise.py) is incomplete. I can complete it later if I am allowed.
