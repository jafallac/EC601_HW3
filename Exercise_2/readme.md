Exercise 2

The outputs of ColorImage.cpp are images of Lenna.png.  

1.) Except for the first image, which is the original version of the image, all images are converted from gray to an individual value that makes up the image.  The first three images after the original image show the image with each individual value of red, green, and blue, respectively.  The next three images show the image with each individual value of Y (luminance), U (color/chrominace), and V (color/chrominace).  The next three images show the Hue, Luminance, and Saturation, respectively, of the original image.  The last three images show the Luminance, A, and B, respectively, of the original image. 

2.) RGB’s pixel values can each range from 0 to 255, where all zeros (0,0,0) would show black, and all 255s (255,255,255) would show white.  YCbCr’s pixel values are between 16 and 235(black to white), 16 and 240, and 16 and 240, respectively.  HSV’s pixel values are 0 to 179 (degrees), 0 to 255, and 0 to 255, respectively.

BGR value: [102 165 156] at (20,25)

HSV value: [ 34 97 165] at (20,25)

YCrCb value: [155 129 98] at (20,25)
