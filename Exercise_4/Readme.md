Exercise 4

When threshold_value is set to 0, the Threshold Truncated image is completely black, and the Binary Thresholding image is completely white.
When threshold_value is set to 255, the Threshold Truncated image is a complete grayscale image, and the Binary Thresholding image is completely black.
For Band Thresholding, if both threshold values are the same, the image is completely black, but if both values are completely opposite of each other (0 and 255), the image is completely white.
