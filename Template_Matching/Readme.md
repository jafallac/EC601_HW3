# Template Matching Exercise

In this exercise, I used OpenCV to locate my wallet in the source image, and a red rectangle surrounds the wallet to show this.
Since my wallet was not held straight in the picture, the template image shows a small amount of the objects surrounding the wallet, and the red rectangle does not completely surround the wallet.
