Exercise 3

The pictures show the results for mean = 0.0, sigma = 50, and noise_percentage = 10.  The image used is Lenna.png.

Note: I could not properly complete this exercise. Two images are blank (The Box and Gaussian filters), and the Salt and Pepper Box, Gaussian, and Median look the same.  As a result, I only uploaded one of the blank images to represent both the Box and Gaussian filters, and one image for the Salt and Pepper's Box, Gaussian, and Median image.
