Exercise 1

A cvMat object is read in this order: bit depth, data type, and number of channels.  The bit depth is the number of bits that make up each channel.  The data type of the channels can be 32-bit floats (32F), 16-bit unsigned integers (16U), or other types.  A pixel value is equal to 2 to an exponent equal to the number of bits (e.g. with 8-bits, there are 2^8 = 256 values for a pixel).
